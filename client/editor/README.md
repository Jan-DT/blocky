## Blocky Editor

**Please note that the Blocky Editor is not even close to being functional.**

This package is a very early experiment with a visual editor for Blocky.

The idea is to have a Godot-like editor (maybe even as a Minecraft client mod),
which allows for the creation of objects, traits, worlds etc. in a user-friendly way.

For this, I am looking at Swing, in combination with FlatLaf.
Any possibility we could render the OpenGL window of Minecraft to a Swing panel?

If anybody has any better ideas, please share them!
