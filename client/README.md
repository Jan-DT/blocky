## Blocky Client

**Please note that the Blocky Client is not even close to being functional.**

This package is a very early experiment with a visual editor for Blocky.

The idea is to have a Godot-like editor (maybe as a Minecraft client mod),
which allows for the creation of objects, traits, worlds etc. in a user-friendly way.

For this, I am looking at Swing, in combination with FlatLaf.
If anybody has any ideas on the execution, please share them!
