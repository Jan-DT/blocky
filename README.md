## About the project

Blocky is meant to be like a game engine for Minecraft servers, built on top of [Minestom].
Where Minestom tries to be as hands-off as possible (which is what makes it so cool),
Blocky tries to provide a complete, and sometimes opinionated,
toolset for building entire games in Minecraft.

The main goal of Blocky is to make the experience of building games as simple and seamless as possible.
To achieve this, we aim to provide a game engine-like architecture inspired by Unity and Godot,
with many common features like animation, path-finding and maybe someday even a visual editor.

At this point in time, Blocky is still very much in the planning phase,
and every update might (and probably will) include many large breaking changes.
This means that you probably shouldn't be using Blocky to build any projects yet.

Some features that could possibly, one day, be added:

#### Engine
- [ ] Fully functional object-trait (component) system
- [ ] Migrate to using just Minestom scratch
- [ ] Serialization system for objects and resources
- [ ] Animation system
    - Simplified API for particle animations
- [ ] Pathfinding system
- [ ] AI system (something like Goal-oriented Action Planning)
- [ ] Implementations for common things like:
    - Custom entity models, using projects like [WSEE](https://github.com/AtlasEngineCa/WorldSeedEntityEngine)
    - Custom resource pack support (for things like UI)
    - Persistent data storage
    - Support for autoscaling

#### Ecosystem
- [ ] CLI tool for project/file generation
- [ ] A visual editor client mod?

Please note that these are just some random ideas. Let me know your feedback!
