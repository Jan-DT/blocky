### Git Guidelines

To keep the Git repository organized, we try to follow both the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines,
and [this branch name convention](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534).

#### Branching Strategy

The `main` branch is the most up-to-date branch.
All changes, fixes, pull requests etc. will be merged with this branch.
Stable versions will be prepared using a `release/1.2.3` branch.
After a version is deemed stable, it will be pushed to a `stable` branch (which is not yet available).

### Style Guidelines

To ensure a consistent and streamlined codebase,
we expect contributions to follow a few guidelines.

Code is expected to follow styling conventions in the following order:
- The existing conventions used by this project.
- The conventions used in [Minestom](https://github.com/minestom/Minestom).
- The conventions used by Java.
